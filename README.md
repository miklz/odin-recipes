# odin-recipes

This project is an introduction to web development. I'm following [The Odin
Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) to learn HTML, CSS and Java Script.

This repository in particular is a website applying the lessons to build
a simple webpage. When finished, I will have a recipe website with basic
structure - headings, paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists, links, and
images - and file hierarchy, but without CSS yet.
