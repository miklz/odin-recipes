        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Pumpkin pie is an all-time holiday dessert classic. The contrast of
            spiced pumpkin against cold, tangy cream cheese is a gift I look forward to
            every fall.</p>
        <p>This recipe swaps out cream cheese for swirl of luscious, smooth,
            mascarpone.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Fit pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish and place it on a baking sheet. </li>
            <li>Combine pumpkin puree, condensed milk, eggs, and pumpkin pie spice
                in a large bowl. Mix until combined and set aside.</li>
            <li>Make the cheesecake swirl: In a medium, microwave-safe bowl stir
                together mascarpone, milk, maple syrup, and flour.</li>
            <li>Microwave on high power until the cheese is completely melted, 20
                to 30 seconds. Stir the mixture until completely smooth.
                (This will make swirling easier.)</li>
            <li>Add about two-thirds of the cheese mixture into the pumpkin filling
                and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven, set on a wire rack, and cool completely
                before serving.</li>
        </ol>
